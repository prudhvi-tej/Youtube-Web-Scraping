Starting your first job can feel like stepping into the unknown. In this episode, we sit down with Saugat, Founder & Director at TEO Tribes, who has worked with top companies like Airtel, OYO, and Leverage Edu. He shares real-world advice to help freshers navigate their careers with confidence.  

We kick things off by tackling a big question, why does sales have such a bad reputation? Saugat breaks the myths and explains why understanding sales is important in any career. If you're about to start your first job, he shares practical tips on how to settle in, make a strong impression, and grow quickly.  

Before joining a company, do you really research it properly? Many don’t, and that can be a huge mistake. We discuss why researching an organization matters and how it can shape your future. We also get into the importance of professionalism, the little things that can make a big difference in how you're perceived at work.  

Thinking about freelancing instead of a corporate job? We weigh the pros and cons so you can make an informed decision. And of course, no career conversation is complete without talking about communication skills, why they matter and how to improve them to boost your career.

Which Programming Language Should You Choose in 2025?
With new frameworks and technologies springing up every year, deciding on a programming language might feel overwhelming. However, 2025 brings a few front-runners to the spotlight:

Python remains top-tier for AI, data science, web development, and its vast ecosystem of libraries.
JavaScript/TypeScript drive the modern web forward, powering dynamic front-ends and robust back-ends (Node.js).

Go (Golang) gains traction for its concurrency features, scalability, and simplicity in building microservices and cloud applications.

Java continues to be a reliable workhorse in enterprise, Android app development, and large-scale systems.

Kotlin is a strong choice for Android development and is recognized by Google as the go-to for mobile apps.

Ultimately, picking the right language depends on your target industry, the community support you need, and your personal interest. If you’re aiming for AI or data science, learning Python might boost your opportunities. Interested in high-speed or low-level applications? Rust or Go could be the future. Web dev enthusiasts can always benefit from advanced JavaScript/TypeScript skills. Whichever path you choose, mastering problem-solving skills and core concepts will keep you agile in the ever-changing tech world!

*Learn Recursion in just 5 minutes 😮 | DSA Made Simple*


Recursion is a powerful concept in computer science and an essential topic in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). In this quick 5-minute guide, we'll simplify recursion and show you how it works with easy-to-understand examples. Whether you're preparing for coding interviews or just brushing up on your DSA skills, this video will break down the complexity of recursion and make it simple for you.

Recursion allows functions to call themselves to solve a problem in smaller chunks, making complex problems more manageable. We'll cover the basics, including the recursive function structure, base cases, and common mistakes to avoid. You'll also learn how recursion is used in popular algorithms like Fibonacci series and factorials.

Don't miss out on this quick and easy guide that makes recursion simple and understandable!

What is Dynamic Programming? |  Data Structures & Algorithms | GeeksforGeeks,8 months ago,1.3K views,https://www.youtube.com//watch?v=ad6UqyoZ9Hk,"Welcome to the next video of our DSA Course, where we dive into the concept of DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING.

Welcome to the next video of our DSA Course, where we dive into the concept of DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING.

In this video, We'll break down how DP stores solutions to subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.

We will solve classic DP problems like Fibonacci Sequence and Longest Common Subsequence, with clear 
explanations. Learn how to recognize situations where DP can be applied to optimize your code.

Explore different DP approaches (top-down vs. bottom-up) and choose the best fit for your problem. And discover how DP is used in various coding scenarios, from bioinformatics to text editing.

Welcome to our Machine Learning Project Series! 📊🔍 Join us as we dive into the realm of media integrity, focusing on the crucial task of Fake News Detection using Machine Learning techniques.

Drawing from two distinct datasets sourced from Kaggle—one containing fake news and the other comprising genuine news—we navigate through the complex landscape of data preprocessing and feature engineering. With the aid of TF-IDF to unravel word weightage and regex functions to refine our dataset, we lay a solid foundation for our predictive model.

Join us as we explore a myriad of classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier, each offering unique insights into the authenticity of news articles.

In this Project, we will see how to develop real-time human face detection in Python using OpenCV. The objective of the program given is to detect objects of interest(faces) in real-time and to keep track of the same object. Face Recognition is a part of computer vision where we locate and visualize faces using ML models in any digital image. 
OpenCV contains many pre-trained classifiers for face, eyes, smiles, etc. Face detection using Haar cascades files is a machine-learning approach where the model is trained with a set of input data. 

You need to download the trained classifier haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml from here: 
https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree...
 
which is available in OpenCv’s GitHub repository.

Coding is the most in-demand and upcoming skill of the industry and it will continue to grow as the years pass. Despite all this, students often restrict themselves from getting started with coding, and not only students, but the parents are also not very much active in encouraging their wards to learn to code.  

And we believe now is the time to break this stigma around this conversation and to promote coding culture among students and create genuine interest & curiosity in them to get started with coding. Keeping this in mind, GeeksforGeeks is coming up with an exciting coding tournament exclusively for school students!
